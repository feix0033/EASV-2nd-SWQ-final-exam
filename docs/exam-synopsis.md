# Synopsis Structure

This is an example of a synopsis structure that you can use for the synopsis in my courses. This document outlines the sections and describes the content of each section.

Adapt it to the scope and topic of your project.

# 1. Introduction / Motivation

The motivation for picking this particular problem to work on should be clearly communicated in the synopsis. Explain why this problem is interesting for you to work and why it will be interesting for others to read about. Feel free to include any background information that that is required to understand the context of the problem.

The synopsis is a short documentation of your project work.

# 2. Problem statement

This project is a personal financial tracking application developed using Nest.js (Node.js). The application allows users to record daily financial transactions, including income and expenses, store the entries locally and calculate financial summaries such as daily totals, income, expenses and profit/loss.

The main focus of this project is **software quality and testing**. The application is used as a test project to demonstrate:
- Unit testing
- Data-driven unit testing
- Use of mocking frameworks in a non-.NET environment
- White-box testing techniques

The project combines relevant theory from the course with practical implementation and testing, showing how testing techniques can be applied in a real-world application.

# 3. Methodology

In this section you should describe how you intend to analyze and solve the problem. Refer to relevant litterature or videos that contains information that will help you solve the problem.

Describe in more detail how you will solve the problem: what will you implement? What will you measure? How will you evaluate your measurements?

And finally: What will confirm or reject your hypothesis?

# 4. Analysis & Results

This is the meat of your synopsis.

You have to outline what you have done in this section. Document the effort you've put into analyzing the problem and also the work you've done building and implementing a solution.

This isn't your GitHub repository. You should not include all the code you've written. Instead, you should include the most important parts of your work.

What is important? Parts of the code that are a result of your analysis and the choices you've made. Connect theory and analysis to how the code is written.

Demonstrate that you understand the theory and that you can apply it to solve a problem. Don't expect and plan for creating a "product". Write only enough code, outside your main objective and focus on your problem.

# 6. Conclusion

Summarize.

This is your chance to briefly summarize what you've done throughout the project. Focus on the most important parts and takeways from your work. And finally, what did you find out? Did you confirm or reject your hypothesis?
