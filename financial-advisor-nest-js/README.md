# Financial Advisor - Personal Financial Tracking Application

A personal financial tracking application built with Nest.js (Node.js) that enables users to record, manage, and analyze their daily financial transactions.

## Overview

This application serves as a comprehensive solution for tracking daily income and expenses, with a strong emphasis on software quality and testing methodologies. Users can record financial transactions, store them locally, and generate insightful financial summaries including daily totals, income breakdowns, expenses, and profit/loss calculations.

## Problem Statement

This project is a personal financial tracking application developed using Nest.js (Node.js). The application allows users to record daily financial transactions, including income and expenses, store the entries locally and calculate financial summaries such as daily totals, income, expenses and profit/loss.

The main focus of this project is **software quality and testing**. The application is used as a test project to demonstrate:
- Unit testing
- Data-driven unit testing
- Use of mocking frameworks in a non-.NET environment
- White-box testing techniques

The project combines relevant theory from the course with practical implementation and testing, showing how testing techniques can be applied in a real-world application.

## Features

- **Transaction Management**: Record daily financial transactions (income and expenses)
- **Local Storage**: Persistent local data storage for all financial entries
- **Financial Summaries**: Calculate and display:
  - Daily totals
  - Income summaries
  - Expense breakdowns
  - Profit/loss analysis
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive test coverage ensuring reliability and maintainability

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) v11.0.1
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode
npm run start

# Watch mode (auto-restart on changes)
npm run start:dev

# Debug mode
npm run start:debug

# Production mode
npm run start:prod
```

## API Documentation

This project includes integrated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all API endpoints.

### Accessing Swagger UI

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

The Swagger UI provides:
- Interactive API endpoint testing
- Request/response schemas
- Example payloads
- Authentication requirements
- Comprehensive API reference

### Swagger Configuration

The Swagger documentation is configured in `src/main.ts` and uses decorators in controllers to generate comprehensive API documentation automatically.

## Testing

This project emphasizes comprehensive testing practices:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:cov

# Debug tests
npm run test:debug
```

### Testing Approach

The project demonstrates:
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components and services in isolation
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Using parameterized tests to validate multiple scenarios
- **Mocking**: Utilizing Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate dependencies
- **White-Box Testing**: Applying knowledge of internal code structure to ensure comprehensive coverage

## Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with Prettier
npm run format

# Lint and fix code issues
npm run lint

# Build the project
npm run build
```
